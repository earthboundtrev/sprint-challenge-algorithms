'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):
    
    if word == 't'
        # increment word
        #save the occurence of t somehow
    if word == 'th'
        # implement counter
        # reset word
    else:
        # increment word
